- [ ] Chat conversation from UI to backend to LLM and back
- [ ] Authentication and authorization workflows
- [ ] Error handling and recovery
- [ ] Performance under expected load
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility

## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. Functional Requirements

#### Chat Interface
- [ ] **AC1.1**: Users can send messages and receive responses
- [ ] **AC1.2**: Chat history persists between sessions
- [ ] **AC1.3**: Streaming responses display incrementally as they arrive
- [ ] **AC1.4**: Users can interrupt ongoing responses
- [ ] **AC1.5**: Multiple chat conversations can be maintained simultaneously

#### Knowledge Base
- [ ] **AC2.1**: System correctly incorporates knowledge base data in responses
- [ ] **AC2.2**: Knowledge base data is appropriately cited in responses
- [ ] **AC2.3**: Knowledge base can be updated without system restart
- [ ] **AC2.4**: System falls back to general knowledge when knowledge base lacks information

#### Action Handling
- [ ] **AC3.1**: System correctly identifies when to use registered actions
- [ ] **AC3.2**: Action parameters are correctly extracted and validated
- [ ] **AC3.3**: Action execution results are properly incorporated in responses
- [ ] **AC3.4**: Failed actions provide meaningful error messages

### 2. Non-Functional Requirements

#### Performance
- [ ] **AC4.1**: Initial response time < 500ms
- [ ] **AC4.2**: Streaming responses begin within 1000ms
- [ ] **AC4.3**: System handles 50+ concurrent users without degradation
- [ ] **AC4.4**: Memory usage remains stable during extended operation

#### Security
- [ ] **AC5.1**: All communications encrypted with TLS
- [ ] **AC5.2**: Authentication required for all API endpoints
- [ ] **AC5.3**: Input properly sanitized to prevent injection attacks
- [ ] **AC5.4**: Rate limiting prevents abuse
- [ ] **AC5.5**: Proper error handling prevents information leakage

#### Reliability
- [ ] **AC6.1**: System recovers gracefully from API failures
- [ ] **AC6.2**: WebSocket connections auto-reconnect after interruption
- [ ] **AC6.3**: No data loss during normal operation
- [ ] **AC6.4**: System maintains state during component restarts

## Test Data Requirements

1. **Sample Conversations**: Pre-configured conversation history for testing
2. **Knowledge Base Corpus**: Test documents for knowledge base integration
3. **User Accounts**: Test accounts with various permission levels
4. **Action Definitions**: Sample actions for testing action execution
5. **Error Scenarios**: Defined error cases for testing error handling

## Test Environment

1. **Development**: Local environment with mocked external services
2. **Staging**: Isolated environment with real external services
3. **Production-like**: Environment matching production configuration

## Testing Tools

1. **Backend Testing**: pytest with pytest-asyncio
2. **Frontend Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library
3. **E2E Testing**: Playwright or Cypress
4. **Load Testing**: Locust or k6
5. **API Testing**: Postman or Insomnia

## Defect Management

1. **Severity Levels**:
   - **Critical**: Blocking issue preventing core functionality
   - **High**: Major feature not working as expected
   - **Medium**: Feature working with limitations
   - **Low**: Minor issues not affecting core functionality

2. **Resolution Process**:
   - All critical and high severity issues must be fixed before release
   - Medium issues should have workarounds documented
   - Low issues can be tracked for future releases
