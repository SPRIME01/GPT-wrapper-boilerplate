# ADR 0001: Clean Architecture with Domain-Driven Design

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to establish a robust architectural foundation for the GPT Wrapper boilerplate that promotes maintainability, testability, and flexibility. The system needs to handle complex business logic around GPT interactions while remaining adaptable to different use cases and deployment scenarios.

## Decision
We will implement Clean Architecture principles combined with Domain-Driven Design (DDD) patterns, specifically:

1. **Layer Separation:**
   - Domain Layer (core business logic)
   - Application Layer (use cases)
   - Infrastructure Layer (external concerns)
   - Interface Layer (API/UI)

2. **DDD Patterns:**
   - Aggregates for complex domain objects
   - Value Objects for immutable concepts
   - Domain Events for state changes
   - Repository interfaces for persistence abstraction

3. **Ports and Adapters Pattern:**
   - Inbound ports for external requests
   - Outbound ports for external services
   - Adapters implementing these ports

## Consequences

### Positive
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier to test in isolation
- Domain logic protected from external changes
- Flexible for different deployment scenarios
- Easy to extend with new features

### Negative
- More initial boilerplate code
- Steeper learning curve for new developers
- Potentially over-engineered for very simple use cases

## Implementation Notes
- Use interfaces (protocols in Python) for all ports
- Keep domain models pure from external dependencies
- Implement factories for complex object creation
- Use dependency injection for flexible component wiring
