# ADR 0002: Event-Driven Architecture with Message Bus

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Our GPT Wrapper needs to handle asynchronous operations, maintain loose coupling between components, and support extensibility for various use cases. We need a reliable way to communicate state changes and trigger actions across different parts of the system.

## Decision
We will implement an event-driven architecture using a message bus pattern with the following components:

1. **Message Bus Implementation:**
   - Async event publishing and subscription
   - In-memory implementation for development
   - Pluggable external message broker support (e.g., Redis, RabbitMQ)

2. **Event Types:**
   - Domain Events (e.g., RequestInitiated, ResponseReceived)
   - Integration Events (e.g., ExternalAPIError)
   - Application Events (e.g., UserSessionCreated)

3. **Event Handling:**
   - Asynchronous event handlers
   - Event replay capability for recovery
   - Event sourcing support for audit trails

## Consequences

### Positive
- Loose coupling between components
- Easy to add new features through event subscribers
- Better scalability with async processing
- Improved system resilience
- Clear audit trail of system actions

### Negative
- Eventual consistency challenges
- More complex debugging (async stack traces)
- Need for event versioning
- Potential message ordering issues

## Implementation Notes
- Use Python's asyncio for async event handling
- Implement retry mechanisms for failed event processing
- Add event versioning from the start
- Include dead letter queues for failed events
- Use correlation IDs for request tracing
