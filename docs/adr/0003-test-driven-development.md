# ADR 0003: Test-Driven Development with Comprehensive Testing Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
To ensure reliability and maintainability of the GPT Wrapper boilerplate, we need a robust testing strategy that covers all aspects of the system, from domain logic to infrastructure components.

## Decision
We will adopt Test-Driven Development (TDD) as our primary development methodology, with a comprehensive testing strategy:

1. **Test-First Development:**
   - Write failing tests before implementation
   - Red-Green-Refactor cycle
   - Continuous test execution during development

2. **Test Categories:**
   - Unit Tests (domain models, use cases, services)
   - Integration Tests (adapters, ports, persistence)
   - End-to-End Tests (full user workflows)
   - Performance Tests (load testing, benchmarks)
   - Security Tests (vulnerability scanning)

3. **Testing Tools & Frameworks:**
   - pytest for Python backend testing
   - Jest/Testing Library for frontend
   - Locust for load testing
   - Safety/Bandit for security scanning

## Consequences

### Positive
- High test coverage from the start
- Better design through test-first approach
- Faster debugging and regression testing
- Confidence in refactoring
- Documentation through tests

### Negative
- Initial development slower
- Need for test maintenance
- More code to write and maintain
- Risk of over-testing

## Implementation Notes
- Use pytest fixtures for test setup
- Implement test factories for complex objects
- Use mocks judiciously, prefer test doubles
- Maintain test isolation
- Include performance benchmarks
- Regular security scanning
