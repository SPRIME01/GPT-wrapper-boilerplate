# Application Layer

The application layer is responsible for orchestrating the use cases and services that implement the business logic of the application. It acts as a bridge between the domain layer and the infrastructure layer, ensuring that the core business rules are applied consistently.

## Use Cases

Use cases represent the specific business actions that can be performed within the application. They encapsulate the application logic and coordinate between the domain models and the infrastructure services.

### Example Use Cases

- **SubmitRequestUseCase**: Handles the submission of GPT requests, including validation, API calls, and persistence.
- **ManageSessionLifecycleUseCase**: Manages the lifecycle of user sessions, including creation, updates, and termination.

## Services

Services in the application layer provide high-level operations that are used by the use cases. They abstract away the details of the underlying infrastructure and domain logic, offering a simplified interface for the application logic.

### Example Services

- **CacheService**: Manages cached data, providing methods to get, set, and delete cache entries.
- **RateLimiterService**: Handles rate limiting for API requests, ensuring that usage limits are enforced.
- **SecurityService**: Coordinates authentication and authorization, providing methods for token validation and access control.

## Ports

Ports define the interfaces for communication between the application layer and the external systems. They are divided into inbound ports (for receiving requests) and outbound ports (for interacting with external services).

### Inbound Ports

- **GPTRequestPort**: Defines the interface for submitting GPT requests.
- **SessionManagementPort**: Defines the interface for managing user sessions.

### Outbound Ports

- **GPTAPIPort**: Defines the interface for interacting with the GPT API.
- **ConversationPersistencePort**: Defines the interface for persisting conversation data.

## Summary

The application layer is a crucial part of the architecture, ensuring that the business logic is applied consistently and that the application remains flexible and maintainable. By encapsulating the use cases and services, it provides a clear separation of concerns and facilitates the development of robust and scalable applications.
