# Domain Layer

The domain layer is the core of the application, encapsulating the business logic and rules. It is responsible for representing the key concepts and behaviors of the application domain.

## Domain Models

Domain models represent the core entities and value objects within the application. They encapsulate the state and behavior of the domain.

### Example Domain Models

- **GPTRequest**: Represents a request to the GPT API, including the prompt, parameters, and user context.
- **GPTResponse**: Represents the response from the GPT API, including the generated text and metadata.
- **UserContext**: Represents the context of a user, including preferences, session data, and conversation history.

## Domain Events

Domain events represent significant occurrences within the domain that may trigger actions or state changes. They are used to decouple different parts of the system and enable event-driven communication.

### Example Domain Events

- **RequestInitiated**: Triggered when a new GPT request is initiated.
- **ResponseReceived**: Triggered when a response is received from the GPT API.
- **UserSessionCreated**: Triggered when a new user session is created.

## Summary

The domain layer is a crucial part of the architecture, ensuring that the business logic is applied consistently and that the application remains flexible and maintainable. By encapsulating the domain models and events, it provides a clear separation of concerns and facilitates the development of robust and scalable applications.
